        Coffee is a brewed drink prepare from reasted coffee beans, which are the seeds if berries from the Coffea
        plant.
        <br>The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopa and Sudan) and
        Madagascar, the Comoros Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.
        <br> The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world.
        <br> Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas,
        Southeast Asia, India, and africa.
        <br>The two most commonly grown are arabica and robusta.
        <br>Once ripe, coffee bries are picked, processed, and dried.
        <br>Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, denpending on the desired flavor.
        <br>Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.
